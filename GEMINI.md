## Gemini Added Memories
- The project is a Python-based agent designed to help an engineer write Ruby on Rails applications that adhere to the standards defined in `conventions.md`. The agent uses LLMs to generate PRDs, tickets, and potentially code for the target Rails project.
- The project development is structured in phases. All architecture, progress, and planning for a given phase must be documented in a corresponding `docs/phase-X/README.md` file.
