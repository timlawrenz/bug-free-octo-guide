# Phase 0: Orchestration and User Input

**Status: Complete**

This initial phase of the bug-free-octo-guide project is complete. The foundational components of the orchestration logic have been set up, and a mechanism for receiving user input has been established.

## Key Objectives Achieved

1.  **Orchestrator Script:**
    -   A main orchestrator script has been created at `src/bug_free_octo_guide/main.py`.
    -   An `Orchestrator` class encapsulates the core workflow logic.

2.  **User Input Mechanism:**
    -   The script accepts a high-level feature idea via a command-line argument (`feature_idea`) using the `argparse` library.

3.  **Configuration:**
    -   Initial configuration, such as the LLM model name, is set within the script.

## Outcome

The successful completion of this phase provides the entry point for the entire agentic workflow. The project can now accept a user's feature request and has a structure in place to begin processing it.

With this foundation, the project moves to [Phase 1: Planning and Decomposition](./phase-1/README.md), where the feature idea is transformed into a detailed technical plan.
