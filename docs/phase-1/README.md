# Phase 1: Planning and Decomposition

This phase takes the high-level feature idea provided by the user and transforms it into a detailed technical specification (PRD) and a set of actionable engineering tickets.

## Current Implementation

The initial implementation for this phase is located in `src/bug_free_octo_guide/main.py` within the `Orchestrator` class. The process is divided into two main steps:

### 1. PRD Generation

-   **Method:** `run_phase_1_prd()`
-   **Agent:** `PrdAgent` (from `src/bug_free_octo_guide/agents/prd_agent.py`)
-   **Process:**
    1.  The `Orchestrator` initializes the `PrdAgent`, providing it with the feature description from the user.
    2.  It uses the Google ADK's `Runner` to execute the agent.
    3.  The agent processes the input based on its internal prompt (`prdprompt.md`) and generates a detailed technical specification document.
    4.  The orchestrator saves the output to a file named `prd-output.md`.

### 2. Ticket Generation

-   **Method:** `run_phase_1_ticketing()`
-   **Agent:** `TicketingAgent` (from `src/bug_free_octo_guide/agents/ticketing_agent.py`)
-   **Process:**
    1.  The `Orchestrator` takes the generated PRD from the previous step as input.
    2.  It initializes the `TicketingAgent` with the PRD content.
    3.  The `Runner` executes the agent, which uses its prompt (`ticketprompt.md`) to break the PRD down into a series of structured engineering tickets.
    4.  The orchestrator prints the generated tickets to the console.

## Next Steps

The current implementation successfully demonstrates the core logic of this phase. Future work will involve:

-   Implementing the human-in-the-loop checkpoint for PRD review and approval.
-   Integrating with the GitHub API to automatically create the generated tickets in the project repository.
