# Product Requirements Document: Implement a dark mode feature

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a dark mode feature in our application.  Many users prefer dark mode for improved readability in low-light conditions, reduced eye strain, and a more aesthetically pleasing experience.  Currently, our application only offers a light mode interface, limiting user preference and potentially impacting user satisfaction and engagement. This feature will address this limitation by providing users with the option to switch between light and dark modes.

## 2. Goals

* **Increase user satisfaction:** Provide users with greater control over their visual experience, leading to increased satisfaction and engagement.
* **Improve accessibility:** Enhance the usability of the application for users with photosensitive epilepsy or other visual sensitivities.
* **Reduce eye strain:** Offer a less visually demanding interface, especially beneficial for users who spend extended periods using the application.
* **Enhance brand appeal:**  Modern applications commonly offer dark mode, and its inclusion will strengthen our brand image and appeal to a wider audience.
* **Improve battery life (on applicable devices):**  On devices with OLED screens, dark mode can contribute to reduced battery consumption.


## 3. User Stories

* **As a user with photosensitive epilepsy, I want to be able to switch to dark mode so I can use the application without experiencing seizures.**
* **As a night-time user, I want to be able to switch to a dark theme so that I can use the application comfortably without straining my eyes.**
* **As a user who prefers dark themes, I want to be able to customize my application to a dark mode to improve the visual experience.**
* **As a developer, I want a robust and maintainable dark mode implementation that can easily adapt to future UI changes.**
* **As a product manager, I want to track usage and satisfaction related to dark mode to ensure that the feature is successful.**


## 4. Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**

* Users should be able to toggle between light and dark modes via a clearly accessible setting (e.g., in the settings menu).
* The dark mode should apply a consistent dark theme to all aspects of the application's UI, including backgrounds, text, and interactive elements.
* The dark mode should maintain sufficient contrast ratios to ensure readability for all users.
* The user's selected mode (light or dark) should be persistently stored, so that it is automatically applied upon subsequent launches of the application.
* The system should automatically detect the user's device's dark mode setting (if available) and apply it accordingly.  This setting should be overridable by the user's in-app preference.
* The dark mode should be compatible with all supported platforms and devices.


**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* The implementation should be performant and not negatively impact the application's speed or responsiveness.
* The dark mode should be visually appealing and consistent with the overall design language of the application.
* The implementation should be thoroughly tested to ensure that no regressions are introduced.
* The code should be well-documented and maintainable.
* The feature should be accessible to users with disabilities.


## 5. Success Metrics

* **Dark mode adoption rate:** Percentage of users who activate and consistently use the dark mode feature.
* **User satisfaction scores:**  Feedback from user surveys and app store reviews regarding the dark mode feature.
* **Reduced support tickets related to eye strain:** Monitoring a decrease in support tickets addressing issues related to eye strain or visual discomfort.
* **Improved app store ratings:** Tracking changes in the overall app store rating after the release of the dark mode feature.
* **Battery consumption improvement (on OLED devices):** Measuring the reduction in battery consumption on OLED devices when using dark mode.


This PRD will be updated as needed throughout the development process.
